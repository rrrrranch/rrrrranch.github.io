            I'm a restless creator trapped between pixels and programming languages, obsessively crafting digital platforms that merge software engineering with visceral design. Each project is another chance to bend technology to my will, to make something that speaks truth through both function and form. Based in Buenos Aires, I spend my days wrestling with code and my nights chasing perfect compositions, determined to build digital spaces that feel as real as the concrete beneath our feet.
